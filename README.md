# üêç Python Projects Practice

This repository is a growing collection of Python projects I've created while learning and practicing programming.  
Most projects here are **beginner-level** and built by following tutorials or doing self-practice to strengthen core Python skills.

These are not original or production-level projects ‚Äî just a timeline of my progress.
